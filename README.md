# setup
Took this setup from [primeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua) 
did some small modifications and added some more plugins.

# plugins
- lualine
- Comments
- onedark theme, not a fan of the transparency stuff 
- more to come

# note
- using lsp-zero on branch `1.x`
- run in nvim `:checkhealth mason` if you run into trouble.
    - mason will require node > 16, I used [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
      to control the versions. install a version with 
      ```
      nvm install node 16.3.0
      nvm use 16
      ```
